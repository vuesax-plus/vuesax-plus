# vuesax-plus
🚀 Use pnpm + turbo + changeset + vite + vue3.x + sass to repick vuesax!

## Inspiration

First of all, thank you to everyone at [lusaxweb](https://github.com/lusaxweb) for developing [vuesax](https://github.com/lusaxweb/vuesax). Vuesax is great in both interaction design and user interface design, and I appreciate it.

A large number of users are asking if vuesax will still be updated, but they have never been answered, see https://github.com/lusaxweb/vuesax-next/issues/266.So I created the organization and the repository. I will create a new version of vuesax, it's vuesax-plus.

Welcome everyone to contribute code. 👏
